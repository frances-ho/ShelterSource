Team Community Connect is creating Shelter Source, a web service to
connect poor and homeless Atlantans with social services, charitable organizations, and other sources
of support to help our disadvantaged neighbors get back on their feet and reconnect with their
communities. This project is intended to serve individuals in the Atlanta area who are in need of charity
and social services and who may or may not have the technical knowledge to locate the appropriate
services on traditional search engines. This service will allow users to input the services they need and
will integrate geolocation technology to direct individuals to the nearest facility that meets their needs.
This project will require back end and front end web design, geolocation integration, and extensive
research into the services and facilities available in the Atlanta metro area.

The alternatives to this service are traditional search engines such as Google, Bing, and
DuckDuckGo. These services have an overwhelming amount of information and can be difficult to
navigate for people who are not technologically adept. This project puts all the relevant information in
a carefully curated list that is specifically tailored to the Atlanta area into a simple UI that focuses on
several broadly useful categories that can allow anyone to find the services they need quickly and
easily. The scope of this project is specifically limited to the Atlanta Metro Area, although larger
deployment will be relatively simple once the basic framework is complete.

This project uses commercially available components such as Git, Heroku, and MySQL to name a few, that should be
simple to integrate and easy to test. While the integration of the front and back end of the service is
probably the most interesting technical challenge of this project the wealth of documentation available
for all these components puts it well within the realm of feasibility.

### Updates
- 03/25/18 - Database planning -> Created Enhanced-Entity Relationship diagram (EER) of organized researched data of local shelters. 
- 03/26/18 - Create the database -> Imported researched data of local shelters in Dekalb and Fulton to MySQL database - specified columns and its type, set up primary key and foreign key. 
- 03/26-31/18 - Research to connect database with front-end -> learning to use PHP and SQL for querying.
- 04/01/18 - Successfully connected the database to the front-end -> created a functional .html form containing dropdown menus with various user selected options. Once submitted, the form will connect to the databae via php and return the query in the form of a list of shelters depending on the options selected. 
- 04/06/18 - Successfully deployed the front-end and back-end to Heroku, a free application hosting service. 

### To Do:
- [] Revise the front-end - create a simplify and easy to navigate UI 
- [] Testing - write a testing script and began testing
- [] Deploy final code to Heroku
